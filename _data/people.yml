    I am from Williston, VT and grew up visiting Central American with my family. 
    I love spending time in Guatemala and running Cosechando Felicidad with 
    Brennan and our volunteers. I graduated from the University of Vermont with 
    a Bachelors of Science in Molecular Genetics and am continuing my studies at 
    the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine. I love hanging out 
    with everyone and running the feeding program. When I am not studying or 
    helping with the organization I like to knit and do pottery.

    I am from Reynoldsville, PA and grew up visiting Guatemala with my family. It has been 
    awesome to watch the feeding program grow from one person to what it is today and see 
    our volunteers grow as people and leaders. I am completing my Licensed Practical Nurse 
    degree. I am very passionate about the elderly and plan to continue working with them 
    for the rest of my life. I attend Reynoldsville Methodist Church and enjoy volunteering 
    with them while I am in the US.

    My name is Rocael Bocó Vasquez and I live in Santa María De Jesús. I began helping at 
    the project when I found out that a feeding program had been started and asked if I could 
    help. I have been helping at Cosechando Felicidad since 2014. I enjoy hanging out at the 
    project with the people who have now become my best friends. I have since completed 
    my education. When I am not at the project I like to play soccer and listen to music. I 
    look forward to continuing helping here.
