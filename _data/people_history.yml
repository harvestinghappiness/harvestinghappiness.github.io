    My name is Cristian Ricardo Bocó Cuca and I am from Santa María De Jesús. I 
    graduated in 2014 as an accountant. I work for my family’s business sewing and live next 
    to the Cosechando Felicidad house. I have been volunteering with this organization since 
    2014. In my free time I like to play and watch soccer. I am grateful to help at the project. 
    It is an opportunity to help people, to grow as a team and meet true friends. I feel that I 
    am learning about life and becoming a better person by volunteering.

    Sandra was our first employee in 2014. We got to know her through providing medical
    assistance for her dying husband. At the young age of 25 she became a widow and single
    mother to 3 beautiful and hilarious children. Sandra has a great sense of humor and it is a
    pleasure to have her as one of our employees and support her in this way.
