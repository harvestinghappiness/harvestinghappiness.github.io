  bio: >
    My name is Cristian Ricardo Bocó Cuca and I am from Santa María De Jesús. I 
    graduated in 2014 as an accountant. I work for my family’s business sewing and live next 
    to the Cosechando Felicidad house. I have been volunteering with this organization since 
    2014. In my free time I like to play and watch soccer. I am grateful to help at the project. 
    It is an opportunity to help people, to grow as a team and meet true friends. I feel that I 
    am learning about life and becoming a better person by volunteering.
