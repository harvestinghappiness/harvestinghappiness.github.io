<p><small class="donate-small">Cosechando Felicidad Inc. is a tax-deductible 501(c)3 public charity as recognized by the IRS under the Internal Revenue Code. If you would like to receive a tax receipt for your donation please write a current email address in the subject line of your check or in the memo on an electronic payment. This helps us to conserve paper as well as administrative costs (which are covered by an outside entity of the corporation). Please be advised we send out all tax receipts in December for that year so as to avoid sending out multiple receipts to one individual.</small></p>
