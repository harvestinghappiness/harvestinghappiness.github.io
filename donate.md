If you would like to donate to Harvesting Happiness and their work in Guatemala you can write a check to Cosechando Felicidad Inc. with your email in the subject line and send it to:

<pre>
Cosechando Felicidad Inc.
117 Elk Lane
Williston, VT 05495
</pre>

We are a tax-deductible 501(c)3 public charity as recognized by the IRS under the Internal Revenue Code. If you would like to receive a tax receipt for your donation please write a current email address in the subject line of your check or in the memo on an electronic payment. This helps us to conserve paper as well as administrative costs (which are covered by an outside entity of the corporation). Please be advised we send out all tax receipts in December for that year so as to avoid sending out multiple receipts to one individual.

We are so grateful for the generous support we have received from so many! Because we truly value your financial commitment, we want to assure you that 100% of every donation goes directly to maintaining and expanding these necessary programs. Our directors and board of directors function strictly on a volunteer basis. We are committed to being good stewards of your donation!
