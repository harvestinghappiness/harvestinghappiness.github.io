### Statement of Faith

We believe God is the Eternal King. He is infinite, unchangeable, perfect in holiness, wisdom, justice,
power, and love.

We believe through the grace of God, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we have been given
undeserved forgiveness.

We believe God’s kingdom is everlasting.

We believe God created, upholds, and governs all that exists. His creation is beautiful.

We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit that is a constant in an ever-changing world.

We believe God is our abiding Helper, Teacher, and Guide.

We believe in implementation of the social and cultural implications of God’s commandments for
humanity.

We believe our faith should be visible and concrete model of Christ in all we do, even when words are
not used.

We believe in continually seeking God’s will. Enduring trials with love, patience, and obedience.

We believe in the spiritual unity of believers.

We believe in the Lord’s commandments, and seek to uphold them, knowing it is for our good.

We believe in a God that created us, knows us, and seeks us out. Not because we are perfect, but
because we are His children, and He is our God.
