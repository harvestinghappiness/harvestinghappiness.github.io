  summary: Handmade Guatemalan key fob made from recycled handwoven fabric
  description: Handmade Guatemalan key fob made from recycled handwoven fabric. All fobs feature a metal closure as well as a key ring. The strap is made from recycled traditional shirts called “huipils” that are bought locally from families in need. The bags are then sewn by another family in need in Santa María de Jesús, Guatemala. All fobs are handmade, multicolored, and one of a kind.
