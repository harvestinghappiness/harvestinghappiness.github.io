###Growth

Yet another month is upon us and we are excited to share 
with you more about what we have going on. Last month 
we set up our online donations system. This was a big 
step for us as it allows people to donate more easily and 
allowed us to kick off our food sponsorship program. On 
our website you can choose to sponsor different parts of 
our meals or different meals monthly. This is a way 
people can commit to partner with us and we are very 
excited about it. This month we also started selling 
jewelry in preparation for the holidays. We have 
handmade rings and necklaces available for purchase on 
our Facebook page. All of the proceeds go directly 
towards our work in Guatemala and we hope you will 
consider giving a gift that makes an impact this holiday 
season.

Additionally, plans have been made for several short 
term mission groups to visit us. We are very excited 
about this opportunity. As we continue to grow we find 
ourselves in need of more volunteers. We realize how 
truly important not only the work in Guatemala is, but 
also the work in the US. One of the most beneficial 
things we can do is advocate on behalf of the people we 
serve. We view short term missions as a vehicle for
meals at the project each day. We see missions as an 
opportunity 
for people to come and experience daily life in 
Guatemala and experience who we are as an 
organization. The goal of these trips is to inspire people 
to form lasting relationships and advocate in the United 
States.  To us, a successful organization is run by people 
in the community being served and runs year round 
whether Americans are present or not. These are goals 
we will always strive for. We would be absolutely 
nothing without our Guatemalan volunteers and cannot 
thank them enough for what they are doing.

###Our Volunteers

Our volunteers work incredibly hard to make sure our 
organization continues to run in Guatemala and three 
meals are served every day. We have 20+ volunteers ages 
12-26 who work together to buy ingredients at the 
market, cook the meals, haul the water, wash the dishes 
and everything in between. Their work starts at 6:30 AM 
every day and often continues until 10 PM. They try and 
divide up the mealtimes to make it easier on everyone but 
no matter how you look at it, they volunteer a lot of time 
and energy.

One of our biggest time expenses is our water situation. 
Nowhere in Santa Maria will you find anything that 
would fit our definition of running water in the US. As a 
feeding program, we use a lot of water. We use it to wash 
and cook our food, make coffee, wash mountains of 
dishes, and much more. While we occasionally have 
water at the house, the majority is hauled by our 
volunteers. This means carrying a jug which often 
weighs around 50 lbs from the communal water source to 
our house. Not to mention it takes many trips to get the 
water we need for a single mealtime. Another thing you 
probably don’t think about is the logistics of washing 
dishes. Our volunteers spend hours each day washing 
dishes. There are plenty of dishes to go around when you 
are sometimes feeding 40 people at a mealtime. Keep in 
mind water must also be hauled for this task.

All of this would be a lot of work if it was the only thing 
our volunteers had going on, but it’s not. The majority of 
our volunteers are still in school and also work to support 
their families. Some of them work 13 hour shifts in a 
factory. Others walk 2 hours to work in the fields for 8 
hours and then walk the 2 hours home. Others get up at 4 
AM to iron clothes.

With all this going on you might ask yourself why they 
volunteer. Truth is, they absolutely love volunteering. It 
is a time when they can hang out and serve others. They 
love giving back to their community. Even beyond that, 
we have an immense sense of community amongst our 
volunteers and consider them family. When you spend 
that many hours together cooking, washing dishes, 
hauling water, etc., you get to know each other very well. 
When this feeding program started we were excited that 
people would be able to eat who usually didn’t. We never 
could have imagined the impact our work would have on 
our volunteers. They now have a second place to call 
home. Maybe one with a little less drama, a little more
laughter, and a place where love is always in abundance. 
Almost all of our volunteers come from broken homes of 
some sort as alcoholism and abuse run rampant in this 
village. They now have a place where they can have their 
needs met and no longer have to look for other, more 
destructive, ways to meet those needs. We have seen 
people come out of alcoholism, abusive relationships, 
overcome suicidal thoughts, depression, and even turn 
away from past involvement in gangs. Their volunteering 
gives them hope. When we look at our volunteers and all 
God has done in their lives we see an incredible hope for 
the future.

It is easy to feel overwhelmed and it is probably safe to 
say it happens on a near daily basis. We have no special 
qualifications or superpowers to make us perfect for this 
task. We as well as our volunteers are merely seeking to 
glorify God and be his hands and feet. We are 
continually encouraged by the knowledge that God uses 
people like us to change the world no matter how 
unlikely it may seem.

>“But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame 
>the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to 
>shame the strong. He chose the lowly things of this world 
>and the despised things – and the things that are not – to 
>nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast 
>before him.” 1 Corinthians 1:27-29

###Looking Forward

We are excited to announce that on the 11th of this month 
Brennan will be returning to Guatemala for 6 months. 
She is extremely excited to be returning to Guatemala 
and have the opportunity to once again be the hands and 
feet of Jesus to the people of Santa. Emily has plans to 
return to Santa in January and will remain with Brennan
for 4 months. They are both excited about the 
opportunities they will have to grow the organization 
while once again living in Guatemala. Above all they are 
excited to be able to spend time with their best friends: 
our volunteers. They are looking forward to encouraging 
them and helping to relieve some of the burden of 
running the feeding program.

###Prayer Requests

>“Never stop praying.”~ 1 Thessalonians 5:17

Would you please keep us in your thoughts and prayers 
as we continue to move forward into the future God has 
for us. Please pray for continued safety for Santa Maria 
as the Guatemalan election has finally reached a 
decision. Pray for Brennan as she moves back to 
Guatemala and into our new home next week. Pray that 
God would make clear which short term missions groups 
should come. Pray for wisdom and understanding as we 
continue to learn and grow as an organization. As always 
thank you all for your support. We feel incredibly blessed 
to have so many people standing behind us.
