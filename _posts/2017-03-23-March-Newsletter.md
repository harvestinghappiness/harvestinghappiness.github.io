Wishing you all a joyful start to spring filled with hope and new beginnings. It is refreshing to know
that no matter how dreary things may appear, God has the ability to breathe life so radiant everyone
stops to admire. The time and patience needed during a season of growth make the outcome that much
more beautiful. Transformation is a process. A process that reveals different lessons at each point.

We too, find ourselves in a season of transformation and growth. As we have previously told you, we
were renting space for our feeding program. We spent approximately a year and a half at that project,
and many considered it home. Last month, it became necessary to find a new location. In the midst of
the chaos, God was faithful. With a lot of prayer, and our fantastic volunteers by our sides were we able
to find a temporary location. The entire process of looking and moving happened in less than a week. I
am continually astounded by God’s ability to calm an anxious heart. It is so easy to fall into the trap says
we must control everything. It is even easier to allow worry to overrule what you know God has
promised.

We wanted nothing more than to be physically in Guatemala while this period of transition was taking
place. For us, it was a time of re-declaration that this is God’s. This is in His hands, and we are here to be
His servants. We consider that to be a privilege, even on the hardest of days.

We have graciously been given one more month where we are currently, until we have to relocate
one more time. We will be able to stay at next location until a permanent location is established. After
much prayerful consideration, we have collectively decided as a group to use this situation that may
appear a setback as a time for growth. We have begun to look for a place to call our own. We are
committed to the village and whatever the future may bring while we are there. We are currently
seeking to invest in a location that provides not only the functionality, but also the stability we are
looking for long-term.

I will be in Guatemala for a short time around Easter, and hope to look at some locations our
volunteers have found. We trust that God will guide us as we renew our commitment to Him and His
people. Our goal is to have plans in motion by early fall, and completed by the end of 2017. We are open
to buying a built facility, or buying land and building our own.

We humbly ask for your continued prayers and support as we explore this current season of growth. If
you have any opportunities for us to share what we have been doing, whether near or far, please do not
hesitate to contact us. This exciting growth means we will have increased financial need in 2017 and will 
not be able to accomplish our goals without your help. Please tell your friends about our work in
Guatemala and share any potential opportunities to share with us. We are extremely thankful for this
season of growth and trust God to provide for all our needs in 2017 and beyond.
