Warm greetings from Santa María de Jesús! This December the project will celebrate TEN years of serving the elderly. God is so faithful! Having served the public for nearly a decade, we thought we had seen it all. But, here we are in 2024, and so many curveballs have been thrown our way.

On February 20th a fire broke out on El Volcán de Agua. The fire burned for nearly one week while hundreds of volunteers attempted to control the flames. Firefighters, volunteers, military personnel, and many private agencies worked
around the clock digging trenches to contain the fire.

Locals coordinated efforts to get supplies, food, and bottled water to the volunteers. Many families donated their time, and vehicles to transport volunteers to the furthest point possible
before they set out on foot.

There was an incredible amount of devastation that occurred, not only on the Santa María de Jesús side of the volcano, but also to the Palín and Cuidad Vieja sides. We are grateful for the selfless efforts of the volunteers and firefighters that worked tirelessly to extinguish the fire.

We ask you to continue to pray for the abuelos we care for. We have experienced an overwhelming amount of loss this year. After spending nearly a decade together, it is hard when one is no longer sitting at the table. Not only is it hard on our staff, but also the abuelos who have lost many of their friends.

In the midst of much chaos and grief, we have held onto the small moments of joy.
