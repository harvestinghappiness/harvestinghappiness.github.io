Faithful supporters,

It is often difficult to find the right words to write. There are months where there are few “new” or “exciting” things to mention. Our days are filled with the very ordinary. The most basic tasks. We cook and serve food twice daily. We wash dishes, hang laundry, help the abuelos from bed to a chair, cut their hair, run errands, etc. Though there is very little “new” or “exciting” to tell you about. It is with great joy in our hearts that we complete these often mundane tasks. At the end of the day, helping them with these basic tasks is a privilege and honor.

We received several volunteers in January and February who assisted with the daily chores of the project. They brought so much joy and energy to the project. We are thankful for their servant hearts and desire to advocate for the project while in the US. More than anything we are grateful for them coming and experiencing what our everyday life looks like.


In February the majority of those who receive scholarships began school. All scholarship recipients are currently in college. They are nearing their final exams for the semester. We hope the very best for them as they pursue their education.

The abuelos continue to enjoy receiving letters from their penpals in the US. They also have received special holiday cards from various school groups. Getting colorful cards is one of their favorite things!

We celebrated New Years, Valentine's Day, Mother's day, and many birthdays with the abuelos. Our work here has made all of us extra aware of how quickly we are growing older. We try our best to savor these special times together.

The 7th graders at local school also planned a fun day of activities and prepared lunch for everyone recently!

During Holy Week the abuelos and staff participated in the processions that circulate throughout the town. Together they created a carpet of flowers in the street that is a tradition during Holy Week.

We continue to provide support to seventeen individuals on a monthly basis with medications for their chronic illnesses. We have been able to continue providing transportation to chemotherapy, appointments with specialists, and testing. Several other individuals have been assisted with acute medical needs.

After hand washing laundry for ten years, we received a generous donation for a washing machine. We are so thankful for this generous gift! It has saved us so much time, energy, and WATER!

Our feeding program has both welcomed new abuelos, as well as grieved the loss of many special people. Losing those that we have known and helped care for is difficult. It is hard on our staff, but even harder on the abuelos to look around the table and not see some of their friends.

None of this would be possible without the tireless efforts of our four full-time staff members, two part-time staff members, board of directors on the ground, and volunteers. The majority of our team has been with us for five plus years. They know all of the ins and outs of the daily operations. They wear many hats, and do well dividing and conquering tasks. As an organization we want to invest in those who are investing in the community. We strive to provide flexible work schedules to allow any team member to continue their education. We offer fair pay and benefits for their time serving with us.

Being a small organization, we truly feel the magnitude of each person's support. Whether encouragement, letters, donations of medical supplies, monthly support… We want you to know how thankful we are for each one of you!

We humbly ask for your support as we continue into the last half of 2025.
