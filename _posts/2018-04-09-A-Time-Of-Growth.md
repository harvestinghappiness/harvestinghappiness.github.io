Thanks be to God for all the ways in which He has blessed us during the first quarter of 2018! We continue to fundraise in the hopes of purchasing our current project site. We have been able to make monthly payments, as well as some other larger deposits over the past seven months to pay just over $12,500 thus far. In order to reach our goal, we are still in need of approximately $35,000. We ask to consider partnering with us as we grow and expand our programs. All donations are tax deductible, and one receipt for all of your donations this year will be provided in January of 2019. All checks can be made payable to Cosechando Felicidad Inc.

We are grateful not only for the moments of abundance, but also all the difficult days that drew us closer to Him. While at times it can be discouraging, we continue to celebrate the small victories that occur daily.  We pray that overtime these small, consistent, and intentional acts will have everlasting effects on those we serve.

On the fifth of April, like every month, families in need/single mothers came to the project to receive a bag of groceries. While we understand that what we provide is not enough for an entire month, our goal is to give them a boost each month to help get their feet under them. Eleven single mothers and fourteen families receive groceries monthly. Working in Guatemala, each project comes with its own set of logistical issues. The majority of the food items are purchased in the capital, often one and a half to two hours away with traffic, in large quantities. At least two people from the project must go in order to get everything needed. To avoid traffic, they often leave before five in the morning, and return after lunch. In order to be good stewards of the money we are graciously given, items are bought in a variety of locations at the lowest prices we can find.  We are forever grateful for our volunteers who work tirelessly and invert so much of their time to make sure everything runs smoothly.

As the families come to the project, we take the opportunity to check in with each individual. They often open up about work, their childrenâ€™s schooling, any illness in the family, and home life in general. We cherish our time together. Hearing them talk about their daily lives, and their relentless pursuit of a better future is truly inspiring.

In the same way, we are overwhelming proud of the young adults that are receiving scholarships here with us. It is truly moving to watch them manage their responsibilities at work, school, in their homes, and still be able to complete their requirements with us. Anyone that receives a scholarship is required to come at least one time per week and serve the elderly. We feel very blessed to not have any current issues with any of the teens completing this requirement. Everyone not only follows through with their responsibilities, but do so cheerfully. At the end of May we will be receiving their grades for the first half of the year. In order to continue to receive scholarships they must be passing all classes. We look forward to watching them develop into professionals, and leaders of their community.

Every other Saturday we invite the young adults we assist, as well as other teens from the community to an evening Bible study. These groups not only address biblical topics, but also social issues that majority of the teens are facing. We are hopeful that these groups will continue to grow, and provide a nonjudgmental space for people to talk, and express themselves. The next group will be held April 14th, and will be centered on the topic of trust. In addition to this, we are still in the process of planning for a weekly devotional message to be given to the elderly at our feeding program. Special consideration is being taken while planning for this devotional as the message needs to be accessible to the elderly in both Spanish and their native Mayan dialect. We look forward to bringing you more information about this in the future!

During the month of April we hope to post interviews with our volunteers and board member to our Facebook page. Also, if you have any questions about the project, how we work, or what we do, please message us! We hope to upload videos answering any questions you may have. 

We humbly thank you with all our hearts for continuing to support us, and those we serve. Your prayers, and words of encouragement are felt thousands of miles away. We pray God blesses you in all the countless ways you have blessed us and so much more. 

Much Love and Many Blessings,
Emily Keller and Brennan McMillen
