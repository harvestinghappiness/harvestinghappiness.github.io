Warmest greetings from Santa Maria de Jesus. As we had previously mentioned, we now have two full time employees in charge of the daily functioning of the project, and preparing activities for the elderly. We would like to share with you a little bit of their enormous hearts, and show you why we are so grateful to have them!

### Tell us a little about yourself.

I am Josefina Pich and I will turn 24 years old this year. I am one of ten siblings. Last year I completed one of my goals, and graduated as an LPN. I have been involved with Cosechando Felicidad before it even had a name. I think it has been over four years now. I originally came because I heard there was an opportunity for a scholarship. Little did I know then that it would evolve into one of the biggest parts of my life.

### What makes you want to keep coming? 

I fell in love with the project because I like watching the elders smile. Maybe we cannot give them everything. But we can sit down and talk to them. Exchange stories with them. I think that is what they are lacking, and what they truly want. 

### What have you learned here?

I learned how to cook here, actually cook. The ladies that prepare the food for the elders use all natural ingredients, and they showed me how to. Many doctors and nurses that have come to volunteer with us. I have been able to continue learn my profession, and grow and a person.

### Has there been an experience that has really changed you?

Serving others teaches you things you cannot learn anywhere else. Some things stick with you, they change you forever. One of the elders I loved most, ultimately committed suicide a few years ago. It changed the way I view everything. I never ever want anyone to feel that lonely again. From the point forward I have not only tried harder to spend time with them, but also to remind them they are love beyond measure.  I will never forget him, or all he shared with me. 
### What is the hardest part?
The hardest thing for me is when I feel like I cannot do enough. You want to do more, but sometimes you just cannot. Sometimes I see the people crying, and there is nothing you can do to make it better. It is something that affects us all at the project, but is hard to talk about with people. Thankfully we know that those who also serve understand, and we can lean on them. 

### If you could change one thing about your town, what would it be?

I want to give the women of my town their voice back. I want to teach them to take back control of their lives. This is what I most desire.
### What is your biggest dream?

To open a nursing home.

### What is your life motto?

Love and you will be loved. Forgive and you will be forgiven.

### Is there anything else you want to say? 

There are things to been done, it is best we go do them.

### Tell us a little about yourself.

My name is Edwin Osoy. I am a teacher, and I will be 27 years old this year. I have seven siblings. I have also been coming here for four year. One of my cousins said there was a chance to get a scholarship, so I came. I feel in love with serving the elderly.

### What do you like most about the project? 

I like sharing with those who come to help. It is a place where you can come to distract yourself from whatever may be going on around you.

### Has there been an experience that has changed you while serving?

There was a time when we volunteered to donate platelets for a man who had cancer. He needed a donation ever couple weeks for many months.  Sometimes when I went, I was not able to donate because my own platelet level were not high enough. I wanted to donate, I wanted to help. Thankfully, the last few times I was able to give. But the coolest part about it was the family. We were all so concerned whether or not we would be able to donation or not. But, the family was concerned about us. They always asked if we had eaten, or if we had bus fare, or if we needed anything. I think that is how life is supposed to be. We all take care of each other.

### What is the hardest part about working at the project?

The hardest thing for me is going to the hospital with people. I have been there countless times but, the last time I went, it really affected me. It hurt in a way I cannot explain. The problem is wanting to solve all the problems of the world and not being able to. Watching others suffer hurts. 

### If you could change one thing about your town what would it be?

I want equal educational opportunities for both boys and girls here. This is what I think will transform my town.

We love, and their hearts for the people! They are truly some of the most selfless and humble people we know and so grateful to have them. 

In other news, we ask for your prayers as we continue our search for a vehicle. We are excited to have reached this exciting milestone and all the additional possibilities we will have with a car at our disposal. Right now, we rely solely on public transportation or hiring a vehicle for short trips to assist us in the purchase of our monthly groceries in bulk in the capital, facilitate trips to hospitals and doctors appointments, as well as carry out our daily errands. On any given month we spend up to $300 on transportation costs, so our purchase of a reliable used vehicle will quickly pay for itself. We are also extremely grateful for the opportunity to purchase a vehicle as it not only will serve as a more reliable mode of transportation, but a safer option as well. We have currently secured a safe location to store our future car and are on the hunt! Please continue to pray that we will find the right vehicle for our needs and will be dependable for us. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our car search as we know God will provide in his perfect timing. 

Thank you for your continued support which allows us to continue to serve, and provide job opportunities!
