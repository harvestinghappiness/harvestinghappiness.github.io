<h3>We Are Called</h3>

We are continually overwhelmed by the magnitude of 
God’s goodness he has lavished on us! So many new and
truly powerful things are happening. Doors are being 
opened and lives are forever being changed. So much has 
happened in the past five months, it would be near 
impossible to arrange words in any order to express 
everything that has transpired. In mid-May both Emily 
and I returned to Santa Maria de Jesus, but more
importantly to the people we know and love. We were 
thrilled to be ‘home’ and doing what God had laid on our 
hearts so many years ago.

We quickly dove into work at the feeding program that
was established in December, doing home visitations, 
and seeking medical aid for those stricken by illness. But, 
most importantly old friendships were re-joined and new 
connections were made. After spending six weeks in 
Santa Maria, Emily had to return home to Vermont.

Before flying home, we had numerous conversations in 
regards to what our next steps would be. It was clear that 
our hearts had forever been captured by this beautiful 
community and culture. We decided to make it official! 
Emily wasted no time researching, organizing and 
compiling all the information necessary to apply to be a 
non-profit organization. 

People continually ask us ‘how’ we do what we do. 
There is an enormous amount of work involved with 
running a program such as this. Incalculable hours spent 
doing things you would never even think of. Not only on- 
the-ground work such as hauling water, washing 
hundreds of dishes daily, looking for best food prices, 
searching for medicine, scheduling doctor’s 
appointments, and nightly lines of people waiting to talk 
to us… The list could truly go on forever. But, also here 
in the States. Countless phone calls, emails, bank visits, 
excel spreadsheets and a list of things to plan that would 
make anyone’s head spin.

While filling out the non-profit application we were 
asked “What makes us qualified?” I remember a moment 
of silence before a burst of laughter. On paper, we are a 
group of young adults, no fancy titles in front of our 
names, no claims to fame, nothing extraordinary or 
perfect about us. Which makes this process all the more 
beautiful. In our weakness and inability God is glorified. 
We are thrilled to announce that as of September 10th, we 
are officially a 501c3 non-profit. Not because we are 
able, or qualified or extraordinary but, because God has 
amazing plans for a very special village. 

Throughout this process our desperate need for God 
has been made apparent in more ways than one, but also 
our need for our brothers and sisters in Christ. So easily 
our mind can trick us into thinking we have to do
Cosechando Felicidad Inc. 
everything alone, while that was not how it was ever 
intended to be.

>crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off 
>every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that 
>so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the 
>race God has set before us.”- Hebrews 12:1

We are so fortunate to be constantly surrounded by 
some of the most incredible people we have ever had the 
privilege of knowing. Our Board of Directors is not only 
comprised of the four most hard-working, dedicated, 
compassionate and humble people you will ever meet, 
but they are also our best friends.

The four gentlemen in the photo above have all dedicated 
themselves to serving God through helping their own 
community. They freely donate hours upon hours of their 
time and energy to make these programs possible. While 
Emily and I are state-side they ensure that three meals a 
day, seven days a week are provided to the elderly. They 
relay information to us in regards to medical needs and 
newly developing situations. Together, as a group, we are 
able to depend on each other, to support each other and 
navigate this new, complicated, heartbreaking, humbling 
and exciting journey together. There are numerous 
volunteers that allow these highly necessary programs to 
continue. They were our friends who quickly became our 
family.  We are in this together, for the long-haul and we 
would not want it any other way!
