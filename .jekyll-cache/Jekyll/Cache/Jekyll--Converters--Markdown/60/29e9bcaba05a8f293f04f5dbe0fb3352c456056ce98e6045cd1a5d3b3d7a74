<p>I used to think that because God has overcome the world I don’t have to fear death. Which is true. But I didn’t realize how much it applies to my life; not just my death.</p>

<p>Because God has overcome the world we don’t need to fear. Period. We don’t have to worry about whether we are going to have enough money to feed the people, God already knows.  We don’t need to worry if we can’t solve the people’s problems. Because God has overcome the world we don’t need to be afraid of anything. With all the needs and chaos it is easy to let ourselves get stressed out and consumed by things that are out of our control. If He has overcome the world than he can absolutely overcome the little things in our lives. After all, he has put each person in our lives and knows each of their needs better than we ever will. As long as we are fighting for each of these people with God on our side there is nothing that can’t be accomplished.</p>

<p>God can handle it. He has overcome the world and everything in it. He has overcome sickness, starvation, alcoholism, abuse and so much more. We only need to listen to what he is telling us to do in each moment with each person and love them like He does. We may not be able to handle any of this on our own, but we serve a very faithful God that is more than able.</p>

<p>It isn’t always easy to walk with God but we know he will provide us with the strength for each new day.</p>
